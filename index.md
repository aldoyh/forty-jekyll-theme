# Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a software developer with a passion for learning and teaching. I have a background in computer science and I am currently working as a software developer at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/index.html). I am also a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) mentor for the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044) program.

I am interested in web development, machine learning, and data science. I am also interested in learning new technologies and frameworks. I am currently learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

I am a big fan of [open source](https://opensource.org/) and I have contributed to several open source projects. I am also a big fan of [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) and I have been using it as my main operating system for more than 20 years.
