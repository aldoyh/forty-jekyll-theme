I am a software developer with a passion for learning and teaching. I have a background in computer science and I am currently working as a software developer at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/index.html). I am also a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) mentor for the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044) program.

# My projects

## [Bahrain Airport Campaign Interactive Games](https://doy.tech/projects/orat/) (2021)

This project was developed for [Bahrain Airport Company](https://www.bahrainairport.com/) to promote the [Bahrain International Airport](https://www.bahrainairport.com/). It consists of 3 interactive games that are displayed on a large screen in the airport. The games are developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/).
